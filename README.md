The BLE based Transmitter project of EVRS

The Electronic Voting Response System (EVRS) is our capstone project in the UoM. It contains multiple transmitters (ETX) based on customized PCB and CC2650MODA, a base station (EBS) using CC2650 LaunchXL, a basestation controller (EBC) based on Raspberry Zero W and a PC client software (EPC) based on Java. 

The wireless communication protocol would be Bluetooth LE.
